# How are you gonna pay for it?

Uses the 2018 Budget Function Data from [USASpending.gov](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/budget-function/).

When we talk about such incomprehensibly big numbers it’s impossible to have real perspective. Do you know how many zeros are at the end of a trillion? Can you truly fathom how much a million is? If so, how much more than a million really is in a hundred million?

Move the sliders to the left to remove a percentage from a government budget item and see what it can pay for. You’ll notice that programs in the billions barely make a dent in a bar that requires trillions. Items in the millions can be overfunded by simply touching one of the sliders that operates in billions.
