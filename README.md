Most Americans don’t really know where their taxes go. When we talk about such incomprehensibly big numbers it’s impossible to have real perspective. Do you know how many zeros are at the end of a trillion? Can you truly fathom how much a million is? If so, how much more than a million really is in a hundred million?

Move the sliders to the left to cut a percentage from a government budget item and see what it can pay for. You’ll notice that cutting programs in the billions barely makes a dent in a bar that requires trillions. Items in the millions can be overfunded by simply touching one of the sliders that operates in billions.
